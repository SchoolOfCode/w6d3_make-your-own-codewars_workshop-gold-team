/* Santa has left his Christmas planning 'til the last minute!!! You being his right-hand-elf, must quickly
assemble the Nice list before tomorrow morning!

 Your task will be to return an array of all children who will receive a gift. The child will receive a gift if:
 *They have been nice AND
 *Left cookies for santa AND
 *Is under 16 years of age

Santa is picky about how his list looks - have the format EXACTLY as follows:
Name: x. Gift: y.

Where x is the childs name and y is the expected gift.
